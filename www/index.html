          I do server-side work on the back-end, client-side work on the front-end, and lots of other stuff in between. My uncommon versatility makes me self-reliant, enthusiastic about my work, and useful to others.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
          Presently I am looking for creatively challenging work on the front-end that pushes the limits of my abilities.
